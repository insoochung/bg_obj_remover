# Image segmentation model

We can grab something from the web.

- [TF tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/segmentation)
- [Berkeley dataset](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/)
- [Segment anything](https://ai.facebook.com/datasets/segment-anything-downloads/)
- [Masked R-CNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN)

Data: needs to have labels.

# Image in-painting model

We have to train this.

- [DeepFill v1, v2](https://mmediting.readthedocs.io/en/v0.12.0/inpainting_models.html)
- [PConv](https://github.com/MathiasGruber/PConv-Keras)
- [Image in-painting tutorial](https://wandb.ai/ayush-thakur/image-impainting/reports/An-Introduction-to-Image-Inpainting-Using-Deep-Learning--Vmlldzo3NDU0Nw)
